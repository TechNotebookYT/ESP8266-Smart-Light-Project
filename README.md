# ESP8266-Smart-Light-Project

This is the repository for my ESP8266 Smart light project. 
So, if you want a tutorial on how to flash all this code on to the raspberry pi nad NodeMCU Esp8266, you will need to go to my youtube channel, Tech Notebook.

Make Sure to credit Tech Notebook on any re-distribution.
